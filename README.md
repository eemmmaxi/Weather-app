## Overview

The Weather App is a responsive web application that allows users to search for and view real-time weather information for any location worldwide. Users can see current weather conditions, including temperature, weather icons, and detailed location data. The app also provides additional metrics such as "feels like" temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. 

A 7-day forecast and an hourly forecast are available, enabling users to plan ahead with confidence. The interface supports toggling between metric and imperial units, as well as switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature.
